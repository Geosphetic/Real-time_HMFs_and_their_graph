# Real-Time-Recognition-of-Handwritten-Math-Functions-and-Drawing-their-graph

This is an expanded system for the real time recognition of handwritten Mathematical Functions. This system recovers a function from its moments and then constructs the graph in constant time when the pen is lifted. This system reads and draws the graphs of dozens of handwritten mathematical functions way before an image or manual input is fed by the user using Optical character Recognition (OCR) or other existing traditional systems.

This tool makes math a way more understandable and easy to teach. Math is the subject that every one of us at kid once hated the most. Math is not a subject to be hated. It is indeed the most logical, important, and interesting subject to learn. And this system intends to make math thrilling and entertaining as well.

This system enhances the interesting way to study in the way that computer screen cannot deliver. It helps in making the learning very effective and interesting.

We believe this is the future of teaching because it enhances the process of education by creating a new learning experience and better quality of teaching.
